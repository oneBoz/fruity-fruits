# fruity-fruits

## Implemented User Stories

1. As a customer, I want to see a list of fruits that are available to buy (complete with stock and pricing information), so that I can decide which fruits I want to buy.

2. As a customer, I want to keep track of the fruits and quantity that I have shortlisted (including the total amount I need to pay), so that I can adjust my purchasing decisions as I shop.

3. As a customer, I want to submit my order of the fruits I selected, so that I can complete my purchase when I am done shopping. Assume that payment is done separate from this POS application.

4. As an owner, I want to see the orders that my customers have submitted, so that I can fulfill their orders.

7. As a customer, I want to be able to log in and see my order history, so that I can track my previous purchases.

11. As a customer, I want to be able to use the app on my phone so I can shop on the go.

12. As a customer, I want my order shortlist to be saved so that I can continue shopping on my device layer, even if I have not logged in.

15. As an owner, I do not want my customers to be able to see the whole store's order history, or amend my stocks, or perform any actions that should only be available for me.
